    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
    The Asynchronous Scaleout Camel Driver is an Apache Camel component which sends the
    camel message body to a specified UIMA AS processing pipeline. There are basically two usage scenarios.
    The Camel Driver can be used to drive the processing of a UIMA AS cluster in which each server instance
    runs a cas multiplier to fetch the actual document from a database. In this scenario the camel route only
    sends an ID of the document to the cas multiplier which does the actual fetching of the document.
    In the second usage scenario the Camel Driver is used to send a document in a one way fashion to a
    UIMA AS processing pipeline which then takes care of processing it.

    <para>The Camel Driver has the following URI format
     <programlisting>uimadriver:authority?queue="nameofqueue" </programlisting>
    which could for example be specified as
